## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9af6ccd: MNE-271: `mneia init` can create a project, so the CLI loop can be entered at all.

  `init` was bound to a stub that always rejected, and there was no project-creation path
  anywhere — `/api/v1/projects` was `GET` only and `createProject` returned `501`. A new
  `POST /api/v1/projects` creates or attaches idempotently on the workspace slug, the workspace
  is resolved from the bearer token rather than the payload, and the CLI is wired to it.

  Also fixes rehydration ranking: the hosted rehydrate route imported an embedding provider and
  never passed it, so the semantic weight scored every item identically and the task string
  affected nothing about which items came back (MNE-272).

- 76a23a9: MNE-271: `forbidden` joins the API error vocabulary, and the CLI names the fix.

  `POST /api/v1/projects` refuses a member creating a project that does not exist yet, so the wire
  needed a code for it. `403` previously decoded as `invalid_token`, which would have told a
  customer their credentials were bad when the real answer is that only a workspace lead can create
  a project. The CLI surfaces the server's message and tells them to ask a lead.
